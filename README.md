File : "8-Puzzle problem using BFS-DFS-Astar.py"
             Discription: This file contains code that implements the 8 - puzzle problem using 3 different algorithms, namely breadth first
             search (BFS),Depth First Search (DFS) and A*.

             It also measure the performance parameters of each algorithm like 
             1.RAM usage (which is dependent on the system)
             2.time taken to reach solution
             3.Nodes traversed to reach the solution
             4.Maximum depth explored with in th etree search
             5.Depth of solution. 
             
             Execution: you can execute the program using the command 'python3 8-Puzzle problem using BFS-DFS-Astar.py <state of the 8 puzzle
             board as string>. (where 0 represent the empty tile and solution is 012345678)
